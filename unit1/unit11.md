The roles of journalism in a digital age <span class="sans">(p.3)</span>:

1. Giving a voice to the voiceless

>[...] with such abundance of information it is easier than ever to overlook those who do not have the ability or access to publish their stories online. 

2. Make the hidden findable

>Journalists have the ability to shine a spotlight on these corners, and make it easier for other to dig deeper into them.

1. Giving a voice to the voiceless
2. Make the hidden findable
3. Connect communities

>The algorithms of search engines and social media make it easier than ever to search for -- and find -- information which confirms our own biases (what is called 'confirmation bias'). [...] If there is a risk that communities become more isolated in their own <span class="highlighted">'filter bubbles'</span>, it is vital that journalists remember that their role is to stand outside those bubbles -- and poke holes in them.

## How did we get here?

The web became so popular that it was confused/used interchangeably with the internet. 

- Early adopters: focus on "being there"
- Dotcom boom and bust: too much money spent, no profits made
- Web 2.0 and the rise of participatory media: blogs and "everyone is a media outlet"

## Web-only publishers

<div class="margin-bottom:2em;">&nbsp;</div>

>Instead of hiring journalists to fill pages of content, [these web-only publishers] instead hired community managers who could stimulate discussion, recruit contributions -- and create content too. <span class="sans">(p.13)</span>

## The rise of data driven journalism

![The world's largest data leaks. Source: Niall McCarthy, [The Scale Of The Paradise Papers Leak](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/11/06/the-scale-of-the-paradise-papers-leak-infographic/)](img/20171106_Paradise_Papers.jpg){width="600"}

## The rise of data driven journalism {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

Other sources of data:

- Sensor journalism and drones
- Robot journalism and augmented journalism

>[...]'[a]lgorithms cannot ask questions, explain new phenomena, or establish causality' (Graefe 2016). Journalists would still be needed to observe non-quantified events, and help form public opinion. <span class="sans">(p.15)</span>

## The rise of data driven journalism{data-transition="fade-in slide-out"}

Other sources of data:

- Sensor journalism and drones
- Robot journalism and augmented journalism

>[...] a 'data-driven' approach to investigations could provide and alternative to the traditional 'hypothesis-driven' approach, allowing computers to highlight unusual patterns in data rather than relying solely on journalists to decide on the 'story' that they were expecting to find (Broussard 2014). <span class="sans">(p.15)</span>

## Mobile-first

<div style="font-size:.9em;">

- Huge diversity of devices: screen size and orientation, bandwidth
- Platform publishing: may allow to "do away with a website altogether" <span class="sans">(p.18)</span>
- But then... platforms become publishers too!

>[...] Facebook was employing journalists to curate its Trending Topics section, rather than leaving it to algorithms. The reports led to claims of bias, and Facebook moved quickly to fire the team (this in turn led to a new 'fake news' problem). <span class="sans">(p.19)</span>

- Voice interaction: Siri, Alexa...

## History of a media outlet

In groups,

<div class="small">

1. Choose a media outlet (local newspaper, magazine of interest...)
2. Go to the [WaybackMachine](https://archive.org/web/web.php):
    - Type in the web address of your site of choice
    - By clicking on the years displayed, build up a picture of how many pages, multimedia features and designs the site has had
    - Can you chart its major turning points? For example, when it started to add interactive features, or user-generated content, a responsive design...
3. Choose the most relevant screenshots to briefly present the evolution of your site to the class
