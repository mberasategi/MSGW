## The Internet

A decentralized network of computers:

The result of a **cooperative effort** governed by a series of **standards and regulations**, with the objective of sharing information. 

There are many ways to share information over the internet, standardised  methods of transferring data or documents, known as **protocols**.

## The Web

<div class="center" style="margin-top:3em;">

...?

</div>

## The Web

>A system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in a markup language called HTML (_HyperText Markup Language_) that supports links to other documents, as well as graphics, audio, and video files. This means you can jump from one document to another simply by clicking on hot spots. 
>
>There are several applications called Web browsers that make it easy to access the World Wide Web.
>
>_World Wide Web_ is **not** synonymous with the Internet.

## The Web

>The **World Wide Web** (**WWW**, or simply **Web**) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (**URI**).

<figure style="text-align:right;"><figcaption>
from [Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One](http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/)
</figcaption></figure>

<div style="fragment">
Thus, the web is defined by specifications such as

>- URIs,
>- the HTTP protocol, and
>- the HTML language.

</div>

## The Web: URIs

A **uniform resource identifier** (**URI**) is a string of characters used to identify a name of a web resource. 

Such identification enables interaction with representations of the web resource over a network (typically the World Wide Web) using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI.

<div class="center">
Reading: [Cool URIs don’t change](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html.en)
</div>

## The Web: URIs

A URL is a URI that, in addition to identifying a web resource, specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation: providing both the primary access mechanism, and the network "location". 

<div class="fragment smaller">
For example, the URL `http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page` refers to

>- a resource identified as `/wiki/Main_Page` 
>- whose representation, in the form of HTML and related code, is obtainable via HyperText Transfer Protocol (`http://`) 
>- from a network host whose domain name is `example.org`.
</div>

<figure style="text-align:right;margin-top:1em;"><figcaption>

</figcaption></figure>

## The Web: HTTP protocol

<div class="small">
The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (**HTTP**) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.
</div>

<figure style="text-align:right;"><figcaption>
from [Wikipedia, HyperText Transfer Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperText_Transfer_Protocol)
</figcaption></figure>

<div class="smaller" style="color:#444;">
For a comprehensive list of protocols available through the Internet, see [_Application protocols_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_protocol) in Wikipedia. [Section “Use and culture” in the _History of the Internet_ article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet#Use_and_culture) also does an overview of different protocols and services, in a more “human” language. 
</div>

## The Web: HTML language

**HTML** or *HyperText Markup Language* is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a <span class="highlighted">web browser</span>.

<div class="fragment">
The purpose of a **web browser** is to read HTML documents and compose them into visible or audible web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page.
</div>

<figure style="text-align:right;"><figcaption>

</figcaption></figure>

## The Web: HTML language

HTML elements form the **building blocks** of all websites. 

<div class="small">
HTML allows **images and objects** to be embedded and can be used to create **interactive forms**. 

It provides a means to **create structured documents** by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 

It can **embed scripts** written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages.
</div>

<figure style="text-align:right;"><figcaption>

</figcaption></figure>

## The Web: HTML language {.small}

Web browsers can also refer to **Cascading Style Sheets** (**CSS**) to **define the appearance and layout** of text and other material. The W3C, maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, encourages the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML.

<figure style="text-align:right;margin-top:-20px;"><figcaption>
from [Wikipedia, HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
</figcaption></figure>

In general, authors should use style sheets to achieve stylistic and formatting effects rather than HTML presentational attributes.

## The Web

Just another way to share information over the internet.
