## What is the W3C?

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an **international community** where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to **develop Web standards**. 

During its first moments, the W3C formed a neutral and facilitating forum, as well as contributing technically qualified staff, that allowed to generate consensus among developers on how to advance. 

Led by Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to **lead the Web to its full potential**. 

## W3C mission

The W3C's mission is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web. Below we discuss important aspects of this mission, all of which further W3C's vision of **One Web**.

## Design principles: Web for all

The social value of the Web is that it enables human communication, commerce, and opportunities to share knowledge. One of W3C's primary goals is to make these benefits available to all people, whatever their hardware, software, network infrastructure, native language, culture, geographical location, or physical or mental ability.

## Design principles: Web for all

<blockquote>
    <p>The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.</p>

## Design principles: Web on everything

The number of different kinds of devices that can access the Web has grown immensely. Mobile phones, smart phones, personal digital assistants, interactive television systems, voice response systems, kiosks and even certain domestic appliances can all access the Web.

## Design principles: Web on everything

W3C’s mission includes ensuring that the Web be available on as many kind of devices as possible. With the surge of powerful mobile devices in the past few years, the role of the Web as a platform for content, applications and services on these devices is increasingly important.

- [mobile Web applications](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/mobileapp) can take full advantage of the technical progress in the Open Web Platform, including [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/html), [CSS3](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/css), numerous JavaScript APIs — in particular device APIs who allow deeper integration with the hosting device; see the [list of Standards for Web Applications on Mobile](http://www.w3.org/Mobile/mobile-web-app-state/);
- [W3C widgets](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/widgets) offer a packaging format to distribute Web-based applications;
- <span class="fragment highlight-red">the [Mobile Web Best Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp) and the [Mobile Web Application Best Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp) offer guidance to developers on how to create content and applications that work well on mobile devices;</span>
- <span class="fragment highlight-red">mobile devices are available in areas of the World where computers and fixed Internet access won’t be available for long if ever: W3C is also exploring ways to use the [Web on mobile devices to bridge the digital divide](http://www.w3.org/2008/MW4D/);</span>

## Vision: Web for rich interaction

The Web was invented as a communications tool intended to allow anyone, anywhere to share information. For many years, the Web was a "read-only" tool for many. Blogs and wikis brought more authors to the Web, and social networking emerged from the flourishing market for content and personalized Web experiences. W3C standards have supported this evolution thanks to strong architecture and design principles.

- [Web Architecture](http://www.w3.org/standards/webarch/)

## Vision: Web of data and services

Some people view the Web as a giant repository of linked data while others as a giant set of services that exchange messages. The two views are complementary, and which to use often depends on the application.

- [Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) <span class="fragment">&larr; linked data</span>
- [Web of Services](http://www.w3.org/standards/webofservices/)

## Vision: Web of trust

The Web has transformed the way we communicate with each other. In doing so, it has also modified the nature of our social relationships. People now "meet on the Web" and carry out commercial and personal relationships, in some cases without ever meeting in person. W3C recognizes that trust is a social phenomenon, but technology design can foster trust and confidence. As more activity moves on-line, it will become even more important to support complex interactions among parties around the globe.
