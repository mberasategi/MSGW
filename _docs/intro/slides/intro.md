## Teaching-learning strategy {.smaller}

Competencies are developed progressively through the 4 thematic units and their knowledge must be conceptual as well as theoretical and practical. Such knowledge will be supervised through review of exercises and activities made by students. They will be worked as follows:

#### 1. Analysis and explanation of contents
The teacher will coordinate the development of the syllabus in face-to-face classes, presenting and analysing concepts, arguments and basic analysis that each student must prepare and widen, individually or in groups, to follow each one of the face-to-face classes.

## Teaching-learning strategy {.smaller}

#### 2. Activities
Students will carry out eight activities (two for each unit) throughout the term, to apply the knowledge and abilities of the subject. There will be individual and group activities of different kinds: debates in class, projects, presentations to the class, tutorials and a final exam.

Of the scheduled activities, some will be made in class and they will later be commented and evaluated, also in class. The four activities corresponding to the active experimentation of each unit (projects 1, 2, 3 and 4) will be started in class and will be developed outside the classroom. They will later be evaluated and graded, and suggestions will be offered for improvement. Specific instructions for each assignment will be available to students.

## Assessment {.smaller}

The following evidences are used for the assessment and grading of this subject:

<div class="small">
- A **final exam**, making up to 40% of the final grade. This exam consists of two parts:
    - Objective test: 20% of the grade
    - Practical test: 20% of the grade
- **Individual activities** making up to 15% of the final grade
- **Team projects** making up to 45% of the final grade
</div>

To obtain a pass grade, all parts must be passed (group activities, individual activities and final exam). The extra exam session will require to pass the parts failed in the previous session.

## Tutorials

The hours for face-to-face tutorials are Mondays and Thursdays in the afternoon.

It is compulsory to **schedule an appointment** for tutorials through the class website, at least two days in advance. 

**Email** or **instant messaging** may also be used for any inquiry (miren.berasategi@deusto.es), as well as the discussion board, where you can also **try and answer questions from your fellow students**.

## Attendance {.small}

You will be asked to sign a list every class in order to take attendance. There are **no specific grades given for attendance**, but it will be used to round off the final grade as follows:

- If attendance to classes is 75% or more, the final grade will be rounded up.
- If attendance to classes is below 75%, the final grade will  be rounded down.

Taking into account that the final grade is given with one decimal, attendance (or lack thereof) will account for 0.1 points maximum in the final grade.

## Workshops & focus on current events

> You have to make stuff. The tools of journalism are in your hands and <span class="highlighted">no one is going to give a damn about what is on your resume, they want to see what you have made</span> with your own little fingies. Can you use Final Cut Pro? Have you created an Instagram that is about something besides a picture of your cat every time she rolls over? <span class="highlighted">Is HTML 5 a foreign language to you? Is your social media presence dominated by a picture of your beer bong, or is it an RSS of interesting stuff that you add insight to?</span> People who are doing hires will have great visibility into what you can actually do, what you care about and how you can express on any number of platforms.
