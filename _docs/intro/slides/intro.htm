<h2>Teaching-learning strategy</h2>
<p>Competencies are developed progressively through the 4 thematic units and their knowledge must be conceptual as well as theoretical and practical. Such knowledge will be supervised through review of exercises and activities made by students. They will be worked as follows:</p>
<h4 id="analysis-and-explanation-of-contents">1. Analysis and explanation of contents</h4>
<p>The teacher will coordinate the development of the syllabus in face-to-face classes, presenting and analysing concepts, arguments and basic analysis that each student must prepare and widen, individually or in groups, to follow each one of the face-to-face classes.</p>
</section><section id="teaching-learning-strategy-1" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Teaching-learning strategy</h2>
<h4 id="activities">2. Activities</h4>
<p>Students will carry out eight activities (two for each unit) throughout the term, to apply the knowledge and abilities of the subject. There will be individual and group activities of different kinds: debates in class, case resolution, presentations to the class, tutorials and a final exam.</p>
<p>Of the 8 scheduled activities, four will be made in class and they will later be commented and evaluated, also in class. The four activities corresponding to the active experimentation of each unit (activities 2, 4, 6 and 8) will be started in class and will be developed outside the classroom. They will later be evaluated and graded, and suggestions will be offered for improvement. Specific instructions for each activity will be available to students.</p>
</section><section id="assessment" class="slide level2 smaller">
