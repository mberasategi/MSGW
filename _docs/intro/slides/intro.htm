<h4 id="analysis-and-explanation-of-contents">1. Analysis and explanation of contents</h4>
<p>The teacher will coordinate the development of the syllabus in face-to-face classes, presenting and analysing concepts, arguments and basic analysis that each student must prepare and widen, individually or in groups, to follow each one of the face-to-face classes.</p>
</section><section id="teaching-learning-strategy-1" class="slide level2 smaller">
<h2>Teaching-learning strategy</h2>
<h4 id="activities">2. Activities</h4>
<p>Students will carry out eight activities (two for each unit) throughout the term, to apply the knowledge and abilities of the subject. There will be individual and group activities of different kinds: debates in class, case resolution, presentations to the class, tutorials and a final exam.</p>
<p>Of the 8 scheduled activities, four will be made in class and they will later be commented and evaluated, also in class. The four activities corresponding to the active experimentation of each unit (activities 2, 4, 6 and 8) will be started in class and will be developed outside the classroom. They will later be evaluated and graded, and suggestions will be offered for improvement. Specific instructions for each activity will be available to students.</p>

<ul>
<li>If attendance to classes is 75% or more, the final grade will be rounded up.</li>
<li>If attendance to classes is below 75%, the final grade will be rounded down.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have to make stuff. The tools of journalism are in your hands and <span class="highlighted">no one is going to give a damn about what is on your resume, they want to see what you have made</span> with your own little fingies. Can you use Final Cut Pro? Have you created an Instagram that is about something besides a picture of your cat every time she rolls over? <span class="highlighted">Is HTML 5 a foreign language to you? Is your social media presence dominated by a picture of your beer bong, or is it an RSS of interesting stuff that you add insight to?</span> People who are doing hires will have great visibility into what you can actually do, what you care about and how you can express on any number of platforms.</p>
