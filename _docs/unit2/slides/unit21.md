## Assignment 3

<div class="small">

Let's have a look around and see if we can **work out the structure** of an existing website.

Each group must **choose a website** and **identify its underlying structure**. Try to make as comprehensive an examination as possible.

Each group must **[submit a PDF file](https://alud.deusto.es/mod/assign/view.php?id=15855)** containing

- the title and URL of the selected website, and
- their view on its structure.

## Information interaction design

<div class="center" style="font-size:1.5em;">
websites = experiences

<p>[...] the experiences we create in our products are viewed in a much wider context by our audiences.</p>

## Information interaction design

Information Design, Interaction Design and Sensorial Design must all be taken in mind when designing experiences. What is more,

>addressing one factor without the others can contribute to an experience that is incomplete or unbalanced.

Some are complex but structurable tasks, such as...

### Sensorial design?

<div class="center small">
STRUCTURED = information design, interaction design
UNSTRUCTURED/CHAOTIC/CREATIVE = sensorial design
</div>

<div style="font-family:Satisfy, serif;">

>- Is graphic/visual design a mere question of taste?
>- Is it possible to create _beautiful_ things following a method or structure?
>- Will everything designed to be functional be necessarily ugly?

Good design does not have to be ugly. It has to be oriented to providing great experiences to <div class="fragment grow" style="display:inline-block;padding:0 .5em;">the user</div>

<div class="fragment center" style="padding:2em 0;font-family:Satisfy;">
Have <span class="highlighted">the user</span> in mind. All the time.  
He/she is the one getting the experience.
</div>

&rdsh; This is called **User Experience** (more on this later on this Unit).

## Assignment 4

The objective of this assignment is to **design the structure of a website**. To accomplish this, each group must complete these task at least:

<div class="small">

1. Define a website project. The type of website to create, the context it will work on and the needs it will respond to are all issues to be addressed and specified.
2. Design the **website structure**.
3. Produce the **content** for the website, combining multimedia elements.
4. Graphically design the look and feel **of the home page** of the website, and present it using HTML and CSS.

</div>

## Assignment 4

Each group must [submit](https://alud.deusto.es/mod/assign/view.php?id=15857): 

- the **project in written format** (a PDF file), and 
- the HTML and CSS files for **the homepage** (compressed into a ZIP or RAR file).
