<p>[...] the experiences we create in our products are viewed in a much wider context by our audiences.</p>

## Information interaction design

Information Design, Interaction Design and Sensorial Design must all be taken in mind when designing experiences. What is more,

>addressing one factor without the others can contribute to an experience that is incomplete or unbalanced.

Some are complex but structurable tasks, such as...

### Sensorial design?

STRUCTURED = information design, interaction design
UNSTRUCTURED/CHAOTIC/CREATIVE = sensorial design

<div class="fragment" style="margin-bottom:1em;margin-top:2em;">Is graphic/visual design a mere question of taste?</div>

<div class="fragment" style="margin-bottom:1em;">Is it possible to create _beautiful_ things<br/>following a method or structure?</div>

<div class="fragment">Will everything designed to be functional<br />be necessarily ugly?</div>

<div style="height:2em;">&nbsp;</div>

Good design does not have to be ugly. It has to be oriented to providing great experiences to <div class="fragment grow" style="display:inline-block;padding:0 .5em;">the user</div>

<div class="fragment center" style="padding:2em 0;">
Have <span class="highlighted">the user</span> in mind. All the time.  
He/she is the one getting the experience.
</div>

<div class="fragment smaller center" style="font-family:Satisfy, cursive;">
&rdsh; This is called <u>user experience</u> (more on this later on this Unit).
