How is online audio different to radio?

- Not so much listened to as _background_. Headphones/mobile phone.
- Production: "content is as long as it merits" (p.161)

---

>One of the key differences between radio and online audio is that online audio almos always has a _visual_ element: your clip, stream or podcast will be associated with a still &ndash; or sometimes moving &ndash; image to illustrate it. You also need to think about the _text_ surrounding it. (p.181)

---

>You need to make sure that <span class="highlighted">the speaker can be heard above any background noise</span>, that sound levels are good and consistent and, if possible, use a microphone. (p.161)

---

Convenience (mobile phone) _vs._ quality (studio)

---

Sound **levels** need to be 'just right'. Extremes to avoid:

- Audio that is too _quiet_ =  need to struggle to hear
- Audio that is too _loud_ = becomes distorted and uncomfortable to listen to

---

>It is important to know where the microphones are placed so you don't make the mistake of covering the microphone with your finger when recording. (p.164)

---

>Recording 'in the field' often results in more interesting and livelier sound, so don't be afraid to get out there &ndash; but you will have to allow time for editing afterwards. (p.171)

AND make sure you test your equipment before going out.

## Podcasts

>Podcast subscriptions are based on <span class="highlighted"><i class="fa fa-rss-square"></i> RSS technology</span>: most podcasts are made available via an RSS feed so listeners can subscribe to it and are alerted to fresh content. (p.176)

Podcasts are often submitted to more than one platform at the same time.
