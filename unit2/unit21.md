# Highlights

## {.center}

>When anyone can seek out information about topical issues online, advanced search skills become a must for professional journalists. <span class="sans">(p.70)</span>

## Search engines {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

- Rank content on how many other pages link to it  
    &rarr; unlikely that you will find 'exclusive' or suprising information by default
- Some srategies to fine-tune search results:
    + specialist jargon, codes, specific names <span class="sans">(p.61)</span>
    + vertical search engines <span class="sans">(p.63)</span>, which focus on more specific fields
    + search operators <span class="sans">(p.59)</span>

## Search engines: search operators {data-transition="fade"}

<div style="margin-top:2em;">&nbsp;</div>

>Most people use search engines by searching for _what they want to know_. However, to use them more effectively you should describe _what you expect to find_. <span class="sans">(p.59)</span>

## Search engines: search operators {data-transition="fade-in slide-out"}

- `site:`, by specifying the domain that published the information
- `filetype:`, by limiting to particular types of documents
- `inurl:`, `intitle:`
- exclude with `-`, useful to overcome ambiguities
- wildcards like `*`, to leave some room to abiguity
- time range, when it was published
- cache, also available through the WaybackMachine

## Social networks

- Lists allow to filter/classify accounts depending on different criteria
- Dashboards improve the interface to access social networks

Advanced Guide](https://espirian.co.uk/twitter-search-advanced-guide/)</span>

## Finding people {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

- Experts: insiders, academics, observers, campaigners...
    + Find research first, as a way to contact the researcher
    + People search through LinkedIn
- Case studies
- People on the scene

## Finding people {data-transition="slide-out fade-in"}

<div style="margin-top:2em">&nbsp;</div>

>These techniques should be attempted alongside analogous approaches in the physical world, such as contacting organisations representing people [...], or physically going to relevant locations[, or picking up the phone]. <span class="sans">(p.66)</span>

## Alerts and RSS feeds {.small data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

>There are two main techniques that are used for a personal news feed: email alerts and RSS feeds. <span class="sans">(p.52)</span>

- **Google Alerts** to email. Search operators may be used, and then get emailed every time _new_ results are found.
- <div style="width:100px;float:right;margin-left:.3em;">![](img/rss.png)</div>**RSS Feeds** allow to receive a feed of information from a specific source. Feed readers combine different RSS feeds into a single view. 

<table><tr><td>
![](img/netvibes.png){width="300"}
</td><td>
![](img/feedly.svg){width="300"}
</td></tr></table>

## Alerts and RSS feeds {data-transition="slide-out fade-in"}

- These two can be combined &mdash; Google Alerts also provide RSS output (instead of email)
- Further automation is not only possible, but also easy, thanks to
