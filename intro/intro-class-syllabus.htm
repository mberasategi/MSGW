  <h2>Syllabus</h2>

  <p>This subject, framed into the B module entitled “Elaboration and Creation of Messages” in the Communication degree, addresses the different options that the web offers to create messages in different formats from a theoretical-practical point of view.
    At the same time, it analyses the most important changes that the web environment has caused on the context of communication and on the features of the speaker and the recipient, in order to develop competences for a more effective communication in
    this environment.</p>

  <p>The subject will help the student acquire a global perspective of the possibilities and communicative features of the web environment.</p>

  
  <h3><a><a id="competencies"></a></a>Competencies</h3>
  
  <h4><a id="generic"></a>Generic competence: creativity</h4>

  </ul>


  <h3><a id="teaching-learning"></a>Teaching/learning strategy</h3>

  <p><span class="newthought">Competencies are developed progressively</span> along the 4 thematic units and their knowledge must be conceptual as well as theoretical and practical. Such knowledge will be supervised through review of exercises and activities made by students.</p>

  <p>They will be worked as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><span class="newthought">Analysis and explanation of contents.</span> The teacher will coordinate the development of the syllabus in face-to-face classes, presenting and analysing concepts, arguments and basic analysis that each student must prepare and widen, individually or in groups, to follow each one of the face-to-face classes.</li>
    <li><span class="newthought">Activities</span>. Students will carry out four along the semester, either individually or in groups, to apply the knowledge and abilities of the subject. There will be individual and group activities of different kinds: in-depth readings, content planning and production, presentations and a final test. Specific instructions for each activity will be available to students.</li>
  </ol>


  <h3><a id="assignments-and-grades"></a>Assignments and grades</h3>

  <p>The assessment system for this subject uses the following evidences:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="newthought">Individual preparation of classes and weekly follow-up</span> making up to 30% of the final grade.</li>
    <li><span class="newthought">Group activities</span> making up to 40% of the final grade.</li>
    <li><span class="newthought">Final exam</span>, making up to 30% of the final grade.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To pass the subject, all parts must be passed (group activities, individual activities and exam). The extra exam session will require to pass the parts failed in the previous session.</p>

  <p><span class="newthought">You can find descriptions</span> for all the assignments on the <a href="https://alud.deusto.es/mod/page/view.php?id=573754">assignments page</a>.</p>

  <h3><a id="course-policies"></a>Course policies</h3>

  <p><span class="newthought">Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat.</span></p>

  <p>We will follow the <a href="https://estudiantes.deusto.es/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadername1=Expires&amp;blobheadername2=content-type&amp;blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobheadername4=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=Thu%2C+10+Dec+2020+16%3A00%3A00+GMT&amp;blobheadervalue2=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadervalue3=abinary%3Bcharset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobheadervalue4=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22BOUD+73.pdf%22&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1344469345382&amp;ssbinary=true">Student Regulations at the University of Deusto</a>.</p>


  <h4><a id="attendance-and-participation"></a>Attendance and participation</h4>

  <p>Attendance and active participation in class is a duty of students. Specifically, attending less than two thirds of in-class sessions, as stated by Article 27.3 in the aforementioned Student Regulations, could imply the loss of the right to obtain a grade in the ordinary session.</p>

  <p><span class="newthought">Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class</span> and self-registered by each student through ALUD. A QR code<sup>2</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>2</sup> These QR codes will be shown on-screen in a size big enough to scan with your phone. You can use a QR reading app (such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&hl=en">Barcode Scanner</a> for Android or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/barcode-reader-for-iphone/id426941562">Barcode Reader</a> for iPhone) to do this. If you prefer not to use your phone for this, attendance registers will also be available through the course homepage in ALUD; you just need to use the password shown with the QR code to record your attendance.</span> and password will be shown to students first thing before actually starting the class, which the students can use to access the attendance register and record their own attendance.</p>

  <p><span class="newthought">Keeping up-to-date with the contents and preparation of classes</span> will be the first indicator of participation, as self-reported by each student. This is further specified in <a href="https://alud.deusto.es/mod/page/view.php?id=573754#preparation">the Preparation section on the Assignments page</a>.</p>

  <h4><a id="academic-honesty"></a>Academic honesty</h4>

  <p><span class="newthought">Being honest in all your academic activities</span> is also a requirement for students at the University of Deusto<sup>3</sup>  <span class="sidenote"><sup>3</sup> Check <a href="https://biblioguias.biblioteca.deusto.es/c.php?g=208480&amp;p=1495603">this tutorial from the Library</a> to know more about how to avoid plagiarism and respect intellectual property in your academic work.</span>. Plagiarism is considered serious misconduct, and thus it could result in disciplinary actions such as deprivation of the right to attend to class, deprivation of the right to be evaluated, or deprivation of the right to get the degree title.<sup>4</sup> <span class="sidenote"><sup>4</sup> So seriously, just don’t cheat or plagiarize!</span> All violations will be formally reported.</p>


  <h4><a id="course-evaluation-and-evolution"></a>Course evaluation and evolution</h4>

  <p>This syllabus reflects a plan for the semester. Deviations may become necessary as the semester progresses.</p>

  <p>I’d <em>love</em> your help to help improve the class as we go. To facilitate this, at the end of every class, there will be a link to an anonymous Google Form with a few quick questions asking about the clearest and muddiest things from that day. Please fill this out regularly. It will be hard to remember, since we get out so late, but it’s extraordinarily helpful for me.</p>


  <h4><a id="office-hours"></a>Office hours</h4>

  <p>Office hours are set times dedicated to all of you. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me outside of class and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns. Please come by!<span class="marginnote">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/8VNIQ0hSCgndu/giphy.gif" alt="Waiting" /></span></p>

  <p>Outside of regularly scheduled office hours, <a href="https://www.calendar.com/mberasategi/tutorials">you can easily make an appointment with me online</a>.</p>

  <p>This can be a difficult class. <strong>Do not suffer in silence!</strong> Come talk to me!</p>


  <h3><a id="course-materials"></a>Course materials and resources</h3>

  <p>This site, the subject course in ALUD, will be the main reference point and communication medium for the class throughout the semester.</p>

  <p>The main reference will be <em>The Online Journalism Handbook (2<sup>nd</sup> edition)</em>, which you have available for purchase in the university library (Delta). We will be reading sections from this book for every class and cover most parts of it, so it is really important that you have easy and continuous access to the book.</p>

  <p>You will need to listen to one podcast episode roughly every two weeks, in order to fulfill your ongoing <a href="https://alud.deusto.es/mod/page/view.php?id=573754#online-journalism-news">Online Journalism News</a> assignment. Choose one podcast episode from the sources you will find in the list below. It doesn't need to be the latest episode on the podcast you choose: go ahead and look for something that strikes your eye or that you find specially exciting. </p>

  </ul>


  <p>Finally, a more informal way to communicate thoughts, views, and everything else about the subject is the class chat<sup>5</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>5</sup> You can access our RIOT.im chat room <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/!tCJNDOCEkNsmBTonZT:matrix.org">through your browser</a>, and/or download the app to your smartphone (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vector.im/id1083446067">iPhone</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app">Android</a>)</span>. Make sure you post your doubts and difficulties there as soon as they arise, and also make an effort to engage in conversation and debate with your classmates. This can be really helpful to prevent running into paralysing problems during the course. <span class="sidenote"> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/r7Nbr97FsXxXG/giphy.gif" title="Hungry red panda" /></span></p>
