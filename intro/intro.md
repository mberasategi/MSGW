### Clearest and muddiest things 

At the end of each class, we will save 5 minutes to reflect on 

(1) the clearest point, or what you found most evident, helpful, or clarifying from the class, your readings, etc., and

(2) the muddiest point, or what you found most confusing or difficult to understand.

You will submit these to [the class chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#msgw2020:matrix.org){target="_blank"} in the hopes that it lights up the debate and conversation.

<!-- 
## Focus on current events

<div style="font-size:.6em;">

> You have to make stuff. The tools of journalism are in your hands and <span class="highlighted">no one is going to give a damn about what is on your resume, they want to see what you have made</span> with your own little fingies. Can you use Final Cut Pro? Have you created an Instagram that is about something besides a picture of your cat every time she rolls over? <span class="highlighted">Is HTML 5 a foreign language to you? Is your social media presence dominated by a picture of your beer bong, or is it an RSS of interesting stuff that you add insight to?</span> People who are doing hires will have great visibility into what you can actually do, what you care about and how you can express on any number of platforms.
