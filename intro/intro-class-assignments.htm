	<h2>Assigments</h2>

	<p>This page lists general descriptions for all the assignments you will be requiered to hand in throughout the semester. Each assignment will be appropriately described in detail when the time comes, with the specific requirements, deadlines etc. for each. These will be made available both in the <a href="https://alud.deusto.es/course/view.php?id=12489">front page of the course</a> and also in the <a href="https://alud.deusto.es/mod/page/view.php?id=573729">schedule</a>, so make sure you regularly check those.</p>



	<h3><a id="preparation"></a>Preparation</h3>

	<p><span class="newthought">You will get the most out of this class</span> if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engage<sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>1</sup> Take detailed notes, watch the videos and supplementary content, work through the examples given in the textbook, have vivid dreams about them, etc.</span> with the readings<sup>2</sup>.<span class="sidenote"><sup>2</sup> Also (4) ask for help or clarifications if you have doubts!</span></p>

	<p>You will be graded on your attendance and preparation through regular self-reporting backed by the honor system.<sup>3</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>3</sup> Be honest!</span> At the beginning of class once a week, I will post a quiz on ALUD with the following questions:</p>

	<!-- 1. Are you here in class today?
	    - Yes (*3.5 points*)
	    - No (*0 points*) -->
	<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
		<li>How much of this week's reading did you finish?
			<ul>
				<li>100% (<em>5 points</em>)</li>
				<li>75–99% (<em>4 points</em>)</li>
				<li>50–74% (<em>3 points</em>)</li>
				<li>11–49% (<em>1 points</em>)</li>
				<li>0–10% (<em>0 points</em>)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>How well did you read?
			<ul>
				<li>I was engaged and read carefully (<em>5 points</em>)</li>
				<li>I was fairly engaged and read fairly carefully (<em>4 points</em>)</li>
				<li>I skimmed it (<em>2 points</em>)</li>
				<li>I didn’t read it at all (<em>0 points</em>)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Did you listen to a podcast episode this week?
			<ul>
				<li>Yes (<em>2 points</em>) </li>
				<li>No  (<em>0 points</em>) </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Each week is worth 12 points. <em>It is unlikely that you’ll score a 12 every week.</em><sup>4</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>4</sup> But it would be amazing if you did!</span> <!-- I will shift the distribution of everyone’s final preparation score up at the end of the course. --></p>



	<h3><a id="online-journalism-news"></a>Online journalism news</h3>

	<p><span class="newthought">One of the objectives of this class</span> is to be up to date with current advances in online journalism, not only in terms of technologies, but also regarding trends, formats, etc.</p>

	<p>There is an individual weekly assignment that will help with this, consisting on two distinct tasks:</p>

	<h4><a id="listen-to-podcasts"></a>Listen to podcasts about online journalism</h4>

	<p>The <a href="https://alud.deusto.es/mod/page/view.php?id=573687&forceview=1#course-materials">course materials section of the syllabus</a> explains that you need to listen to at least one episode of an online journalism-related podcast <strong>every week</strong>. These will allow you to be up to date in current debates regarding tech, new formats, and other kinds of trends in online journalism.</p>

	<p><span class="newthought">You will then write a short piece</span>, intended to be published online<sup>5</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>5</sup> So try to apply the things you already know about this, and what you will (hopefully) learn during the semester, in your writing.</span>, about the listening you have made for the week. You could just review the podcast you have listened to, or you could write about the underlying topic they handle using them as your main source. Just have in mind that this should be written to be <em>publishable</em> in a blog, for example.</p>

	<p>You will post this piece of writing to the corresponding assignment in ALUD<sup>6</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup>6</sup> Make sure you are aware of specific requirements and deadlines for this.</span> and, sometimes, selected pieces will also be <em>actually</em> published in <a href="http://infocom.deusto.es" target="_blank">Infocom, the digital magazine by Communication students</a>.

	<h4><a id="peer-review"></a>Peer-review other contributions</h4>

	<p><span class="newthought">In a second stage for this weekly task</span>, once the deadline for submissions has been met, you will be peer-reviewing contributions by classmates according to a set rubric. You will automatically be assigned three other contributions (which may or may not be dealing with the same sources you used &mdash; this is irrelevant) and you will need to fill-in a rubric for each.</p>

	<p>Your grade for this individual weekly assignment will be mainly taken from the reviews from your classmates, but part will also correspond to the level of agreement of your reviews of other contributions: this is a measure to prevent individuals being too benign or too strict when evaluating others, as extreme positions in grading get penalized.<span class="sidenote"><sup>7</sup> So be honest and reasonable when filling in the rubrics.</span></p> 


<!-- 	<h3><a id="problem-sets"></a>Problem sets</h3>

	<p><span class="newthought">To practice solving microeconomic problems</span> you will complete a series of 8 problem sets. Many of the questions on these assignments will come from <em>Economy, Society, and Public Policy</em>, some will come from previous courses, and others will come from my head.</p>

	<p>There are 10 possible problem sets on the schedule. <strong>You must turn in 8 of the 10 problem sets</strong>. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. I will not grade these in detail. The problem sets will be graded using a check system:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>✔+:<span class="marginnote"> <em>44 points (110%) in gradebook</em></span> Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.</li>
		<li>✔:<span class="marginnote"> <em>37 points (92.5%) in gradebook</em></span> Problem set is 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. <strong>This is the expected level of performance.</strong></li>
		<li>✔−:<span class="marginnote"> <em>20 points (50%) in gradebook</em></span> Problem set is less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but <em>you must turn in your own answers.</em> You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>four</strong> people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.</p> -->



	<h3><a id="group-projects"></a>Group project</h3>

	<p><span class="newthought">The project will be composed of several deliverables,</span>  each with its own requierements, deadlines, and grading rubric. These are defined roughly here, but will be detailed more in depth when the time comes.</p>


	<h4 id="p1-strategy">Deliverable 1: Content strategy</h4>

<!-- 	<p><span class="newthought">By the end of our 6<sup>th</sup> week (around <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> into the semester)</span> you will submit 
 -->
	<h4 id="p2-report">Deliverable 2: Journalistic report and media sharing plan</h4>

	<h4 id="p3-multimedia-coverage">Deliverable 3: Multimedia coverage</h4>
	
	<h4 id="p4-timeline">Deliverable 4: Timeline</h4>


	<h3><a id="final-exam"></a>Final exam</h3>

	<p><span class="newthought">There will be one final exam</span> covering all the content we have been working with throughout the course.</p>

	<p>The final exam will consist of two parts:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Objective test (multiple-choice &plus; short questions)</li>
		<li>Practical test (open question)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>We will talk about the specifics of the exam more in detail when the time comes.</p>
